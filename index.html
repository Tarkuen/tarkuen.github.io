			<!-- <h1 class="c1h1">I'm a people oriented, agile developer</h1> -->
			<!-- <p> -->
			<!-- Good software is people based. By people based, I am referring to the orientation of software development. Today we are focused on the user experience, given the higher market competition between software services. In order to understand this change in orientation, we need to both understand the business logic embedded in this approach and the global social movement. -->
<!-- With the rise of agile development in the software development industry, we can see a clear argument: The market changes rapidly and the user of the software holds the key to understand what they need. Thus software has to reflect the need for adaptability and it has to embrace change. -->

<!-- This rapid development primarily relies on feedback and extensive testing.  -->
<!-- With the increased competition comes the need for competitive edge. With a market of software with a few dominant players on the global scale, but a high amount of competition on the local markets, there’s a lot of software which solves the same business problems. -->
<!-- So what separates the products? Usability, robustness, support and so forth. In other words, the software is separated by the users experience of the software. -->
			<!-- </p> -->
			
			<!-- <p> -->
			<!-- These 10 guidelines represents a general approach to the professional software. -->
<!-- However with directions comes choices, so what choices do we stand to make? -->
<!-- Direction over choice, Context over Consistency (aka. Appropriate vs. Consistency), iteration over finalization.  -->
<!-- Traditional web design tells us to hold consistency for usability, however we need to understand that the user has a large experience of interfaces and systems, so we need to adapt to the industry conventions.  -->

			<!-- </p> -->

		
	
			<!-- <p> -->
			<!-- 1.	Equitable: Be welcoming. -->
<!-- 2.	Flexible: Provide options. -->
<!-- 3.	Straightforward: Be obvious and not ambiguous. -->
<!-- 4.	Perceptible: Don’t assume anything. -->
<!-- 5.	Informative: Be timely, predictable, uncomplicated and precise. -->
<!-- 6.	Preventative: Provide easy to follow instructions and gently guide users. -->
<!-- 7.	Tolerant: Handle errors respectfully. -->
<!-- 8.	Effortless: Don’t make demands or place restrictions on your users. -->
<!-- 9.	Accommodating: Be approachable, uncluttered and give people room to manoeuvre. -->
<!-- 10.	Consistent: Follow standards, guidelines, conventions and best practices. -->
